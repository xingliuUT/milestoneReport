# Text Data Cleaning and N-Grams Analysis

## Background
This is for Coursera Data Science Capstone Project. The goal is to build predictive text models that predict the next word based on the previously entered words. 

This project uses the natural language processing and text mining tools used in R to clean, tokenize, and conduct exploratory analysis on the large text data sets. 

Text data used in this project includes English texts from news, blogs and twitter which are offered by the company [SwiftKey](https://swiftkey.com/en) in the format of HC Corpora. Plans of how to build the text model will also be discussed.
